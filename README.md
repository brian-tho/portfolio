## Professional Summary

I am a Mechanical Engineer with a bachelors degree from Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. I graduated Magna Cum Laude as a member of the Pi Tau Sigma Honor Society. Outside of class I was involved in other organizations including Northeastern’s American Society of Mechanical Engineers chapter and NU Toys, an engineering club that uses toys to facilitate engineering design and projects.

I have completed three full-time co-ops to diversify and refine my engineering skills outside of university. My first position was as a mechanical engineer at Siemens Healthineers in Walpole, MA, where I worked on machinery and lab equipment in a medical environment. For my second co-op, I was an animatronics engineer at Hasbro Inc. in Pawtucket, RI, where I utilized mechanics, electronics, and programming to create robotic toys. My last co-op was at Starry Inc., a wireless internet startup based in Boston. There I led the effort to create a neighborhood-level antenna enclosure, learned to design for manufacturing, developed test fixtures, and worked with domestic and international vendors. Finally, my capstone team developed a haptically linked robotic arm and exoskeleton to allow users to transmit their motion as a part of Northeastern University’s Avatar XPRIZE Challenge effort.

Now, I am searching for a full-time position in the Greater Boston Area. I am interested in product design, manufacturing, robotics, vehicles, and more!

# **CO-OP EXPERIENCES**
## **Starry Inc.**
### Concealed Antenna Enclosure
**Objectives**
<br>
- Use existing urban antennae in a suburban environment
- Conceal the antennae to comply with town approved specifications
- Make the enclosure environment-proof and have adequate air flow
- Mount the enclosure on top of existing utility poles
<br>

**Challenges**
<br>
- Current Point antennae are large and awkwardly shaped to fit in a cylinder, the desired form of the enclosure
- Enclosure must be sturdy enough for  high wind speeds, rain, and snow, and also be formed so that the wall in front of the antennae     is RF transparent
- Utility poles have varying diameters and tilts that need to be accounted for in the mount
- The overall design must be relatively simple to assemble and light enough for one technician to install
